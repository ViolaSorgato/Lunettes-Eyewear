# Sprint 2

**Today I did the following:**

- I added the APIs endpoints for the user
- I realized I hadn't tested the endpoints for login and logout so I added an issue for it.
- I started testing it but the login didn't work properly.

**Blockers**

- The Stripe connection still does not work properly.
- The login endpoint still does not work and therefore the logout does not work either.
