# Sprint 2

**I had to compensate for the days lost, so I:**

- Set up the database and connected it successfully (after a few attempts)
- Tested that the connection really works by creating random users (which are added to correct collection)
- Expanded the structure of the project by creating more folders and files so they are ready for Sprint 2.
- Completed first retrospective
- No blockers.
