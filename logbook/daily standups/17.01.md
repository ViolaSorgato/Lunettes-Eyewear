# Sprint 3

**Today I did the following:**

- I changed the way I import products, so now they come from MongoDB instead of Stripe
- I added the shopping cart functionalities to the client side (but not checkout) & merged
- I added the register functionalities to the client side & merged
- No blockers today but I need to doublecheck the login functionalities and also decide if I want a separate page for "My account"
