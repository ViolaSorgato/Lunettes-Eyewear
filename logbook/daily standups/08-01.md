# Sprint 1

**Today I did the following:**

- I added the APIs for product and category and tested it.
- I added 2 categories to the db and one test product.
- I created a json file with all the products and gathered infos & images
- I fixed the structure of the folders so it's easier to navigate
- I started connecting Stripe

**Blockers**

- The Stripe connection does not work, I tried a simple connection to checkout
  but I get errors. I tried debugging for a while but it won't work. I'll continue tomorrow.
