# Sprint 2

**Today I did the following:**

- I tried solving the issues and I had handledning with Anders.
- Later I managed to solve the login/logout issue with help of a classmate.
- I worked more on the Stripe connection and managed to solve that bug as well and now the page is correctly redirected to the Stripe checkout.

**Blockers**

- Yesterday's blockers are fixed.
- There are still some missing details but no real blockers now.
